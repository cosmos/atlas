# CLI Binary

The atlas CLI binary is used to publish [manifest](./manifest.md) files that describe [Cosmos SDK Modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.42/building-modules/intro.html) in order to make them discoverable at https://atlas.cosmos.network.

## Installation

To install the Atlas CLI locally just download the repository and install as follows:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cosmos/atlas.git
cd atlas
make install
```


> Note: If you'd prefer to use docker to run commands take a look [here](#docker).


Once the atlas binary is installed you can get an overview of what it does by using `atlas --help`:

```sh
> atlas --help
NAME:
   Atlas CLI - A Cosmos SDK module registry framework

USAGE:
   atlas [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.0.2-16-ge7fede6-e7fede65720e9292f391276de0cb02ef09ecb7f1

COMMANDS:
   server  Start the atlas server
   login   Save an API token from the Atlas registry locally. It a token is not specified, it will read from stdin.
   publish  Publish a Cosmos SDK module to the Atlas registry.
   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h     show help (default: false)
   --version, -v  print the version (default: false)
```

## Manifest

In order for atlas to register your module, it needs to access a manifest `.toml` file that describes the module. This file needs to be accessible from the atlas binary and it's recommended to keep it within the module itself.

View a full outline of the expected contents of a manifest `.toml` file [here](./manifest.md).

For example: The [auth](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/x/auth] module from the Cosmos SDK contains a manifest called `atlas.toml` located at `/x/auth/atlas/atlas.toml`. It looks like this:

```toml
[module]
description = "The auth module is responsible for specifying the base transaction and account types for an application, as well as AnteHandler and authentication logic."
homepage = "https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk"
keywords = [
  "authentication",
  "signatures",
  "ante",
  "transactions",
  "accounts",
]

name = "x/auth"

[bug_tracker]
url = "https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues"

[[authors]]
name = "alexanderbez"

[[authors]]
name = "fedekunze"

[[authors]]
name = "cwgoes"

[[authors]]
name = "alessio"

[version]
documentation = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/master/x/auth/atlas/atlas-v0.39.1.md"
repo = "https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.39.2"
sdk_compat = "v0.39.x"
version = "v0.39.2"
```

> Note: To automate the publication of modules to Atlas try using github actions like those seen [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/.github/workflows/atlas.yml) in the Cosmos SDK repository.

## Publication

Once you've created a Manifest that describes your module you can use the atlas CLI to publish it to the atlas server at https://atlas.cosmos.network.

If it's the first time you've used atlas you'll need to login first. To do this you need to first obtain an API token by logging into https://atlas.cosmos.network using your github account.

Once logged in go to your account page and create a new API token. Give it a name that you can remember and then copy the token that is generated afterwards.

Once you have your API token in hand, use it to login from the CLI using the following command:

```sh
atlas login [token]
```

Now you're able to publish your manifest by using the following command:

```sh
atlas publish -m [path/to/manifest]
```

> Note, you can execute a `--dry-run` first to ensure the manifest is valid

Congratulations! Your module will now show up on the atlas directory website ðŸŽ‰

### Docker

To do the entire publication flow in one command using Docker try the following:

```sh
docker run -v $(shell pwd):/workspace --workdir /workspace interchainio/atlas:latest [APIkey] [path/to/manifest]] [dry-run, default false]
```
